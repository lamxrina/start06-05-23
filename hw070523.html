    <h2>History</h2>
    <h4>Founding to 1990s</h4>
    <span>Bottega Veneta was established in 1966 in Vicenza, Italy by Michele Taddei and Renzo Zengiaro. 
        Crafting artisanal leather goods, the brand developed a distinctive leather weaving design, the Intrecciato, 
        which instantly became Bottega Veneta's iconic look. "When your own initials are enough" became the brand's historic slogan 
        because the crafted Intrecciato made Bottega Veneta's products immediately recognizable, and its logo only appeared discreetly on the inside of its products.</span>
        <h4>2000 to present</h4>
        <span>In February 2001, Gucci a subsidiary of Kering, acquired Bottega Veneta for $156 million. 
            The following May, Patrizio di Marco was appointed CEO, and in June Tomas Maier creative director. 
            Vogue coined the term “stealth wealth” to describe the brand's new style.
            <p></p>
            In 2016, the brand's second flagship store opened on North Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. 
            The company announced it would unify its men and women's shows. During the company's 50th anniversary show
             at the Accademia di Brera, the Bottega Veneta clutch bag carried by Lauren Hutton in the 1980 movie American Gigolo was revived 
             (and renamed The Lauren 1980). In October 2016, Claus-Dietrich Lahrs was appointed CEO of Bottega Veneta. In 2018, 
             Bottega Veneta opened a 6-floor flagship store in Ginza, Tokyo, in a building designed as a tribute to the capital's architectural modernism.
             In January 2018, Bottega Veneta opened a 15,000-square-foot store - its third flagship store - on the corner of Madison and 64th Street in New York City.
             In June 2018, Tomas Maier stepped down as creative director of Bottega Veneta.
